Processor is Hardware which understands only Binary numbers (0,1)

User instruction -> Calculator -> OS -> Processor
User instruction -> calculator -> OS System Routines -> Commands -> ZEROs and ONEs

Processor - 
Low level or Machine language - ZEROs and ONEs
Middle level or Assembly language - Commands
	Commands: add 2 2 , sub 2 2

OS -
System routines

Binary:
0 1 -> 0 1 2 3 4

0 - 0 0
1 - 0 1
2 - 1 0
3 - 1 1
4 - 1 0 0
8 - 1 0 0 0

2 power 0
2 power 1
2 power 2

Octal:
8 power 0
8 power 1
8 power 2

Decimal:
10 power 0
10 power 1
10 power 2

HexaDecimal:
16 power 0
16 power 1
16 power 2

Java Programing Language:

What is Java?

Java is a High Level Programing Language

	High Level: Simple english like statements [object1.addAndPrint()]

	Simple english like statements -> OS -> Processor
	Simple english like statements -> OS System routines -> Commands -> ZEROs and ONEs

Java is a Object Oriented Programing Language (OOP)

	Object Oriented Programing Language has 4 Principles
	1. Encapsulation
	2. Inheritance
	3. Abstraction
	4. Polymorphism
	
What we can develop using Java?
	Standalone Applications, Web Applications, Enterprise Applications

Which company developed Java?
	Sun MicroSystem -> Oracle

Define Java?
	Java is a High level, Object oriented programming language and used to develop Standalone, Web and Enterprise Applications. It was developed by Sun MicroSystem and Now Owned by Oracle.



Explain Object oriented Programing Language Principles?

Object Oriented Programing Language has 4 Principles
	1. Encapsulation
	2. Inheritance
	3. Abstraction
	4. Polymorphism

1. Encapsulation - is the process of binding Data and Functionality together in Single Entity.
	By using class and object we achieve Encapsulation.
	
	Class -> Object 1, Object 2

	Logical - 
	Class { 
		data - data variable
		functionality: data + 2 - method
	}

	Physical - 
	Object 1 {
		data = 3
		functionality: 3+2=5
	}
	
	Object 2 {
		functionality: 0+2=2 <Note: data is 0 by default if we don't assign value>
	}

CODE EXAMPLE:
public class NumberProcessor {

	// Special method called Constructor
	public NumberProcessor(){
		// initialize the data members
		data = 44;
	}
		
	public int data;
	
	public void addAndPrint(){
		
		int addedValue = data + 2;
		
		System.out.println(addedValue);
	}
	
	
	public static void main(String[] array){
		
		NumberProcessor object1 = new NumberProcessor();
	
		object1.data = 3;
				
		object1.addAndPrint();
		
		NumberProcessor object2 = new NumberProcessor();
		
		object2.addAndPrint();
		
		NumberProcessor object3 = new NumberProcessor();
		
		object3.data = 78;
		
		object3.addAndPrint();
		
	}
	
}

Define Class?
Class is a logical structure which has set of Data members and Functionality.
Class is a logical structure which has set of Data members, Methods and Constructors.

Define Variable?
Variable is a name/reference to the memory location and holds the link to that memory location.

Define Method?
Method is a set of instructions to serve the Functionality.

Define Constructor?
Constructor is special method used initialize the data members.
Constructor will have the same name Class name.

Define Object?
Object is physical entity of the Class.
When we create Object, memory will be allocated to Data members of the class and Constructor will called and initialize the data members

2. Inheritance
It is a process of acquiring the properties of Parent/Super class into Child/Sub class
It is a process of acquiring the Data and Functionality of Parent/Super class into Child/Sub class
It is a process of extending the properties of Parent class into Child class

Inheritance is called "IS A" Relationship

Parent/Super/Base
Child/Sub/Derived

we need at least two classes:
Parent
Child

class Parent {

	public Parent(){
		vehicle = "Car";
	}
	
	String vehicle = "Car";
	
	public void drive(){
		System.out.println("Parent: "+vehicle);
	}
}

class Child extends Parent{
		
	public static void main(String[] array){
	
		Child object = new Child();
		
		object.drive();
	
	}
}

1. Single
2. Multi-Level
3. Hierarchical

1. Single Inheritance
It is the of one Child extending the properties of One Parent.

Parent -> Child

class Anil {
	
	String car;
	
	public Anil(){
		car = "Kia";
	
		System.out.println("Anil Constructor Called");
	}
	
	public void driveCar(){
		System.out.println("Driving car:"+car);
	}
}


class Bharat extends Anil {
	
	String bike;
	
	public void driveBike(){
		System.out.println("Driving bike:"+bike);
	}
}

public class Test {
	
	public static void main(String[] arr){
		
		Bharat b = new Bharat();
		
		b.bike = "Pulser";
		
		b.driveBike();
		
		b.driveCar();
	}
}


2. Multi-Level
It is the Process of having Parent-Child Chain Relationship

Parent -> Child -> Child -> Child -> ...

class Anil {
	
	public Anil(){
		car = "Kia";
	
		System.out.println("Anil Constructor Called");
	}
	
	String car;
		
	public void driveCar(){
		System.out.println("Driving car:"+car);
	}
}

class Bharat extends Anil {
	
	String bike;
	
	public void driveBike(){
		System.out.println("Driving bike:"+bike);
	}
}

class Chandu extends Bharat {

	public Chandu() {
		super();
		phone = "Apple";
	}

	String phone;
	
	public void usePhone(){
		System.out.println("Use phone:" +phone);
	}
	
}

public class MLTest{
	
	public static void main(String[] array){
		
		Chandu c = new Chandu();
		
		c.phone = "MI";
		
		c.usePhone();
		
		c.driveBike();
		
		c.driveCar();
	}
	
}

Anil Constructor Called
Use phone:MI
Driving bike:null
Driving car:Kia
